## My Library: simple-qr
My name: Yusuf Mulyo

In this first part project, I played around with the simple-qr library. It was a great start learning to install outside packages/libraries than the default given when downloading Racket. With this library, I was able to create QR code images that are saved in my computer when a procedure is run. The QR code consist of writtings that can just be plain text or a web link that could be scan by your devices and redirect you to the link written in the QR code. I made three QR code where one is just saying Hello World! while the other two are links.
